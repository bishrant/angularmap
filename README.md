# Angularmap
A boilerplate template for using ArcGIS JS api 4x with Angular 7. 
Just fork/download the repo and run
`npm install`.

Why did i even bother creating this tiny template ? 
- Because i'm lazy. ðŸ’¤

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
